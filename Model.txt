              SPAM CLASSIFICATION -->
        
        Classifying mails to classes SPAM and HAM.
          
        Preprocessing -->
          First, create a probability table of words describing 
          P(wS) = P( mail is SPAM | word appears in mail) of words which appears in training set.
          Notice that, P(wH) = P( mail is HAM | word appears in mail) = 1 - p(wS).
        
    Steps -->
        1. Create a feature vector associated to given mail.
        2. Train on the given dataset.
        
        Classifier is ready..
        
    1. Creating feature vector....
    
        Now, create Mail-vector(vector associated with a mail) of size SZ_M using
        probability table created in preprocessing step.
        From the given mail, choose SZ_M/2 words which have lowest probability in the table 
        and SZ_M/2 words which have largest probability in the table.
       
        Feature vector :: 
        
                    -> first SZ_M/2 numbers will be P(wH) in Decreasing order for 
                       every word which have the lowest value of P(wS) and appears in mail.
                   
                    -> last SZ_M/2 numbers will be P(wS) in decreasing order for 
                       every word which have the larget value of P(wS) and appears in mail.
                       
                    -> if number of words in mail is less than SZ_M/2, then empty spaces 
                       in feature vector will be filled by Zeros.
        
    2. Training model....
    
        After that, we will use a neural network of input layer of size SZ_M 
        one hidden layer of size SZ_H and output layer of size two describing 
        likeliness of a mail to be a HAM and SPAM.
        
        
    This is fairly a simple model to build .
